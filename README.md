## Description

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes a web-based security system to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/) and allows you to control it via HTTP requests.

## Domoticz integration

This plugin only works with Domoticz and a selector switch.

This plugin does not use the security panel in Domoticz, but a selector swtich with 3 states (0, 10 and 20), where 0 is Off, 10 is Armed night and 20 is Armed away. Homekit uses 4 states (also Armed home), but I'm not using this. When chosing At home in the Home-app, this is translated to Armed night. With scripting in Domoticz I check if the alarm is armed when certain sensors are triggered and when it is armed a sirene goes off.

## Installation

1. Install [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installation-details)
